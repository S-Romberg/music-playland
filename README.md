# Music Playland
### Startup Weekend Denver - EDU 

Built in essentially one day, this functioning MVP helps kids learn music in a real and beneficial way. Kids learn better with colors, so this app has twelve different colored wands that each correspond to a note in a scale. The child will choose which game they want to play, press start, and click on the egg to see if they can guess what note they hear. In this MVP, a G note plays, so the child will need to press the yellow wand to pass the level. If they don't press the yellow wand, the game prompts them to try again until they can get it right.
